# Verification Integration

This document provides an overview of the integration of the Sample, Scrutinize and Scale (SSaSEITSbSV) verification approach into the DAPO framework.

## Overview

The SSaSEITSbSV paper presents a three-stage verification approach for improving language model reasoning:

1. **Generate multiple candidate responses**: Sample a large pool of responses to increase the likelihood of finding a correct solution.
2. **Verify each response**: Use the model to verify the correctness of each response.
3. **Compare top candidates**: Break ties between high-scoring responses by direct comparison.

This approach has been shown to significantly improve reasoning performance, even with minimalist implementation. The paper demonstrates that this approach can elevate the reasoning capabilities of Gemini v1.5 Pro above that of o1-Preview on popular benchmarks.

## Integration Goals

The integration aims to:

1. Extend the DAPO framework to support the three-stage verification approach
2. Implement Algorithm 1 from the SSaSEITSbSV paper
3. Provide configurable parameters for scaling verification
4. Maintain compatibility with the existing DAPO reinforcement learning system

## Key Components

The integration will involve the following key components:

1. **Verification Module**: A new module that implements the three-stage verification process
2. **Extended Rollout**: Extensions to the vLLMRollout class to support verification
3. **Configuration**: Parameters for controlling the verification process
4. **Integration Points**: Specific points in the DAPO framework where verification will be integrated

See the other documentation files for more details on each component.

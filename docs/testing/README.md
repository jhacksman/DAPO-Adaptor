# Testing Strategy for Verification Integration

This document outlines the testing strategy for the integration of the Sample, Scrutinize and Scale verification approach into the DAPO framework. The testing strategy is designed to ensure that each component of the verification process is thoroughly validated and that the integration does not introduce regressions.

## Testing Goals

The testing strategy aims to:

1. Validate the correctness of each stage of the verification process
2. Ensure that the integration does not negatively impact the performance of the DAPO framework
3. Provide quantitative metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the verification approach
4. Detect and prevent hallucinations through rigorous mathematical validation

## Testing Components

The testing strategy is divided into three main components:

1. [Unit Testing](./unit_testing.md): Testing individual components of the verification process
2. [Integration Testing](./integration_testing.md): Testing the complete verification pipeline
3. [Mathematical Validation](./mathematical_validation.md): Quantitative evaluation of the verification approach

Each component is described in detail in the corresponding document.
